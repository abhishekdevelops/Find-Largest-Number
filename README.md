# 🔍 Find the Largest Number in an Array – JavaScript Logic Project

This is a beginner-friendly JavaScript project that finds and returns the **largest number** in a given array using a simple loop and comparison logic. The result is displayed in the **browser console**.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. An array of numbers is declared.
2. The first element is assumed to be the largest.
3. A loop iterates over the array.
4. If a number is greater than the current largest, it updates the stored value.
5. After the loop, the largest number is printed in the console.
